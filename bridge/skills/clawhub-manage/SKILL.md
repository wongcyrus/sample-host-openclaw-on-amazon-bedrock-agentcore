## From Agent Chat

- "Install baidu-search skill" -> install_skill with `baidu-search`
- "Add the reddit-readonly skill" -> install_skill with `reddit-readonly`
- "Remove the transcript skill" -> uninstall_skill with `transcript`
- "What skills are installed?" -> list_skills
- "Show me available skills" -> list_skills

## Notes

- After install/uninstall, the skill will be loaded/unloaded on the next session start (after idle timeout or new conversation) (web search, file storage, scheduling)
- Only valid ClawHub skill names are accepted (letters, numbers, hyphens)
- Pre-installed skills: jina-reader, telegram-compose
